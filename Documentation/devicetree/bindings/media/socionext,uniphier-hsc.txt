Socionext UniPhier HSC (High-speed Stream Controller)

The Socionext UniPhier HSC subsystem consists of MPEG2-TS input/output and
demultiplexer cores in the same register space.

This interface supports TS serial signals (clock, valid, sync, data) from
external demodulators.

Required properties:
- compatible      : should be one of the following:
		    "socionext,uniphier-ld11-hsc"
		    "socionext,uniphier-ld20-hsc"
- reg             : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts      : should contain DMA and TSI error interrupt.
- pinctrl-names   : should be "default".
- pinctrl-0       : defined TS serial signal pins for external demodulators.
- clock-names     : should include the following entries:
                    "hsc", "stdmac"
- clocks          : a list of phandle, should contain an entry for each
                    entry in clock-names.
- reset-names     : should include the following entries:
                    "hsc", "stdmac"
- resets          : a list of phandle, should contain an entry for each
                    entry in reset-names.

Example:
	hsc {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-ld20-hsc";
		reg = <0x5c000000 0x100000>;
		interrupts = <0 100 4>, <0 101 4>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_hscin2_s>,
			    <&pinctrl_hscin3_s>;
		clock-names = "stdmac", "hsc";
		clocks = <&sys_clk 8>, <&sys_clk 9>;
		reset-names = "stdmac", "hsc";
		resets = <&sys_rst 8>, <&sys_rst 9>;
	};
